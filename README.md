# Node Express Mysql Full Stack

### Overview

A burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express and a homemade ORM (yum!). Follows the MVC design pattern; uses Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app.


### Description

* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* When a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* Each burger on the right side of the page will have a `Delete Button`.  When the user clicks delete, it will be removed from the db and the page.

* This app connects to a MYSQL database with a "burgers" table that stores burgers, allows users to add burgers, and deletes burgers.
